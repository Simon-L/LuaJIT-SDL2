# LuaJIT-SDL2
autogenerated LuaJIT bindings for SDL2 2.0.9

Set CMake LUAJIT_BIN to the LuaJIT directory for installing.

See test folder examples for usage

luajit-async (taken from https://github.com/ColonelThirtyTwo/luajit-async) will be also installed for providing lua functions that can be called from another thread (sdl.MakeAudioCallback and sdl.MakeThreadFunc)
