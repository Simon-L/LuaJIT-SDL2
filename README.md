# LuaJIT-SDL2
autogenerated LuaJIT bindings for SDL2

CMake will use INSTALL_CMOD and INSTALL_LMOD variables for installing SDL2.(dll or so) and .lua files respectively

See test folder examples for usage

luajit-async (taken from https://github.com/ColonelThirtyTwo/luajit-async) will be also installed for providing lua functions that can be called from another thread (sdl.MakeAudioCallback and sdl.MakeThreadFunc)

This repo is used in https://github.com/sonoro1234/LuaJIT-ImGui where you get very usefull GUI widgets.
